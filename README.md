Heading & subtitle

Usually, the title is a greeting with your name. And the subtitle it's a brief text which contains: what do you do, where do you work, or where are you from. It's up to you what to state here.

I used HTML for this part because it provides more options than Markdown (custom align, for example). I prefer it left aligned, but centered looks great too.

Note that I don't use a normal text for the subtitle, but an H3 tag. I think it helps the subtitle to stand out from the rest of the text.
Social media

Between the title and the subtitle, I placed the social media links because I want them to be as more accessible as possible.

The social badges are from shields.io project. Every badge is composed of two things:

    The hyperlink (the <a> tag)
    It has the URL to which the badge will direct.
    The badge image (the <img> tag)
    This will contains the image that markdown will show. It must be placed inside the <a> tag.

An entire badge will look like this:

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewithmiramon/"><img alt="LinkedIn" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-dewithmiramon-black?style=flat-square&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dewithmiramon/"></a>

All you have to change is the href attribute with your LinkedIn profile link and the text of the badge in src after https://img.shields.io/badge/-.

I kept all my badges monochromatic for the ✨ aesthetics ✨ but you can change the colors to the platforms' originals if you want to. I'll leave both versions.

If you need to add a different badge here, search for posts or tutorials on how to make custom badges. I'll list some resources I found useful:

    How To Make Custom Language Badges for your Profile using shields.io.
    How to make custom badges to improve your Markdown documents

Quick information

This part is to let people know you better. The standard items are:

    🔭 I’m currently working on ...
    🌱 I’m currently learning ...
    👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
    🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
    💬 Ask me about ...
    📫 How to reach me: ...
    😄 Pronouns: ...
    ⚡ Fun fact: ...

Of course, you can delete some of them or add your own.

On this part I added a gif on the right side to give some freshness and motion to the page. All you have to do is to download a cool gif from Giphy or Tenor. If I were a developer, I would choose this one 🐶

After you choose a gif, upload it to the repo. I saved mine with the filename data.gif.

And this is the final code:

Stats widgets

And the final part is the GitHub stats widgets. This project was made by anuraghazra, you can take a look at his repo. These widgets are dynamically generated based on your commits, issues, stars, language usage, etc.

What I like the most of these widgets is all the customization possible. Again, I chose a simple theme because I like minimalist stuff, but you can choose yours from the dozens of themes it provides.

<a href="https://dewith.co/"><img height="150px" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=dewith&show_icons=true&hide_title=true&hide_border=true&theme=graywhite" /><img height="150px" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=dewith&show_icons=true&layout=compact&langs_count=6&hide_title=true&hide_border=true&theme=graywhite" /></a>

As you can see, you can customize a lot in the URL: show_icons, hide_title, hide_border, theme, and many others.

If you want the widgets to redirect to your website or to something else, make sure to leave the widgets inside the href of the tag as I do.


If you followed all the steps...

Profiles for design inspiration

My readme ain't much, but it's honest work. And I say it because I've seen impressive profiles, but they are as sophisticated as they are complicated to recreate. But it's up to you how much time and effort you put into building your profile.

There are many collections of GitHub profiles READMEs out there. I will give you two of them that have the profiles categorized, so it is easier to find inspiration.

Hope you find useful this tutorial, don't forget to visit the part II (I'll leave the link here once it's ready).

Please, don't hesitate to leave a comment about any doubt or question you have about the process.

Later!
